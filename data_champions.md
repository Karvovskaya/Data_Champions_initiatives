The Open University Library - a call for Data Champions http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/the_orb/?p=3267 by Isabel Chadwick

EPFL Data Champions - https://www.epfl.ch/campus/library/services/services-researchers/rdm-contacts-communities/epfl-data-champions/ I assume that Francesco Varrato is involved in the program

Very excited about learning from CSCCE. Steve van Tuyl, for example seems to be in a similar position. Trying to make people feel more like a community even if they don't identify as such.
Lou promised more webinars on creating of the leadership roles, ambassador programs. The role of community managers in this process.
