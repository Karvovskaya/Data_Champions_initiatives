# Creating a network of Data Champions (VU Amsterdam)

In my work, I want to bridge the gap between researchers and support personal by creating opportunities for networking and collaboration. On the one hand, researchers stand under high pressure as they are not only required to do research but have to publish, teach and comply with multiple other obligations. There is little time over to develop new skills or explore new tools. On the hand, the university libraries are actively trying to offer researchers support and help that go beyond the classical library tasks like literature search. Thus, the university library of VU Amsterdam is offering a number of services around research data management (RDM). These services are meant to support researchers and to reduce their workload.
The problem is that there is little contact between the two groups: the researchers and the library personal. The lack of contact results in a lack of awareness and possibly even a lack of trust. The library is often unaware of the acute needs of the researchers, especially when particular disciplines are concerned. Many researchers would rather ask their colleagues for help then direct their questions to the library. 
The project that I would like to develop as part of the Innovation Leaders programme is setting up a network of Data Champions. Data Champions are local community member willing to share their discipline-specific expertise with colleagues; they advocate good RDM practice and advise and proper handling of research data. 
Data Champions are supported by the library. Through them, the library gets valuable insights into the needs and practices within various disciplines.  Data Champions help the library to improve its services and to gain familiarity and trust among researchers. Establishing a Data Champion programme also serves a broader goal of driving cultural change towards open science and open data.
